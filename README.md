OwnTV is a native **Android TV** IPTV **player** built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose for TV, and
**libmpv** (FFmpeg). It's a *player only* — you bring your own M3U or Xtream sources, and OwnTV gives
you a fast, modern, remote-first way to browse and watch them.

> ⚠️ OwnTV does **not** provide any channels, playlists, subscriptions, streams, or media content.
> You are responsible for adding your own legally accessible sources.

This is an **open-source** project — the code is original (not derived from any other app) and was
**built with the help of AI**. **Contributions are welcome**: clone, build, and test it freely. It
targets **Android TV only** (leanback launcher, D-pad-first UI).

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Playback (libmpv / FFmpeg)
- Plays virtually any codec/container, and exposes **every** audio and subtitle track (not just the
  ones the device can decode).
- **TV-optimized rendering** — on TV-class hardware the decoder writes frames **directly to the
  display** (the zero-copy pipeline streaming apps use): smooth 4K HDR with the panel's native HDR
  handling and fast channel starts, with subtitles drawn by the app. A **Renderer** setting can
  force mpv's full GL renderer (complete ASS/PGS subtitle styling) on devices that can afford it.
- Custom TV HUD: scrubbable seek bar, prev/next, audio/subtitle/speed pickers, zoom & aspect modes,
  volume, and auto-hide controls.
- Large demuxer cache for smooth 4K/8K streams; **HDR passthrough** when the video and TV support it.
- **Mini-player / PiP** — dock a movie or episode to a corner and keep browsing, then expand or close.
- **Resume, your way** — movies & episodes remember where you stopped; replaying shows a small
  *"Resume at 23:45?"* prompt, with a setting for **Always / Ask / Never** resume.
- 📺 **[Complete player design & feature reference →](extras/player.html)** — an interactive Material 3
  mockup documenting the full player HUD, PiP, popup menus, and remote-key mappings.

### 🧭 Browse
- **Live TV**, **Movies**, **Series**, **Downloads**, and a full **EPG Guide**.
- Folder rail with section-specific **Favorites** and **History** — it expands on focus to show **full
  category names**. Inline per-folder search and a cross-section **global search** — TV-style: search
  bars take focus like any control and only open the keyboard on **OK**.
- **Sort toggle** per section: your **playlist's own order** or **A–Z** (Live TV defaults to playlist order).
- **Customize everything (per profile):** hide, rename & reorder categories; hide & rename channels —
  and it all survives re-syncs.
- Built for scale — tested with ~50k channels / ~168k movies via streaming import and Paging 3.

### 🗓️ EPG
- A full **time × channel guide grid** (XMLTV from Xtream `xmltv.php` or an M3U `url-tvg`), plus
  per-channel **now/next** in the Live preview.
- **Custom EPG URL per source** (Xtream *and* M3U) — your own XMLTV link overrides the defaults.
- **Tune from the guide**: OK on a channel tunes straight to it; programme details have a
  *Watch channel* button.
- Clear status everywhere: the Guide shows *"Guide loaded: N channels · M programmes"*, and each
  source row in Settings shows its own EPG state.

### 👥 Profiles
- Multiple profiles with their own favorites/history/resume, optional **PIN locks** (salted hash) and a
  **kids** flag, and a "Who's watching?" launch gate. Sources can be shared between profiles.

### ⬇️ Downloads
- Offline downloads for **movies & episodes** (never Live TV), with pause/resume and a user-chosen
  download folder.

### 🎨 Personalization & settings
- Material 3 theme (AMOLED dark / light / system), **any accent color** — presets, a palette, or an
  exact **hex code** (the whole theme is generated from it) — UI zoom, per-profile avatars.
- **Video Player** settings: hardware decoding, default zoom, subtitle size & language, audio sync.
- **Complete Backup & Restore** — one file covers profiles, sources, customizations, **favorites,
  watch history, and resume positions** — and you **choose what to include** on export and what to
  apply on restore; per-source User-Agent, refresh-on-startup, default source.
- **In-app updates** — OwnTV checks GitHub Releases (automatically on startup with a small corner
  status card — toggleable — or manually), shows the full changelog, and installs the new APK right
  on the TV. No browser, no storage permission.

### 🛡️ Robustness
- **Sized for real TVs** — the player's memory budget scales to the device (lean stream buffers on
  low-RAM panels), a decode watchdog blocks 4K/8K software-decode death spirals with a clear error,
  backgrounding releases the stream immediately, and the app sheds caches under memory pressure.
- All player commands run **off the UI thread** — a stalling stream can never freeze the remote (no ANRs),
  and fast preview-scrolling coalesces loads so only the channel you land on is opened.
- **Connection-friendly**: preview → fullscreen reuses the same stream (no reconnect — kind to strict
  1-connection providers), and a dropped live stream **auto-reconnects** before showing an error + Retry.
- Offline detection with a banner, and friendly, offline-aware error messages on import/sync/guide.

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Area | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Language | Kotlin 2.3.10 (AGP 9 **built-in Kotlin**, no `kotlin-android` plugin) |
| Build | AGP 9.2.1 / Gradle 9.4.1, KSP2 2.3.9 |
| UI | Jetpack Compose for TV (`androidx.tv:tv-material` 1.1.0), Compose BOM 2026.05.00 |
| Media | **libmpv** (FFmpeg) — `dev.jdtech.mpv:libmpv` |
| Database | Room 2.8.4 + Paging 3.5.0 + FTS4 (WAL) |
| DI | Koin 4.1.1 |
| Networking | OkHttp |
| Images | Coil 3.3.0 |
| Preferences | DataStore |

`minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 36`, `applicationId tv.own.owntv`.

> **Build note:** Kotlin comes from AGP 9's built-in Kotlin (no `kotlin-android` plugin). KSP 2.3.6+
> supports built-in Kotlin, so Room codegen works alongside it; the Compose compiler and KSP track
> Kotlin 2.3.x.

## ⚙️ How it works (backend)

- **Parsing & sync** — M3U playlists are line-streamed and Xtream `player_api` JSON is read with
  `android.util.JsonReader`, so huge provider payloads are never fully buffered. `SyncManager` does a
  clear-then-insert refresh in ~500-row chunked transactions with Flow progress and cancellation.
- **Storage** — a 19-entity Room schema: profiles & sources (`ProfileSourceCrossRef` for sharing),
  content (categories/channels/movies/series/seasons/episodes), per-profile favorites/history/progress/
  downloads, EPG channels/programmes, and FTS4 search tables. Totals come from indexed `COUNT` queries.
- **Lists** — Paging 3 with a bounded `maxSize` keeps memory flat across 50k+ item lists.
- **EPG** — bulk XMLTV is stream-parsed (gzip-aware) into a rolling now→+48h window and pruned.
- **Player** — a single hoisted `libmpv` surface drives preview, fullscreen, and the mini-player, with
  state published as `StateFlow`s for the Compose HUD.
- **DI** — Koin modules (`appModule`, `databaseModule`, `dataModule`, `playerModule`).

## 📥 Installing (Fire TV / Android TV)

Grab the signed APK from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest) and
sideload it. A fixed link always points at the newest signed build:

```
https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk
```

- **Fire TV** — install the **Downloader** app (by AFTVnews) from the Amazon Appstore, then enter the
  **Downloader code `4308278`** (or [`aftv.news/4308278`](https://aftv.news/4308278), which always
  points at the latest signed `OwnTV.apk`). Enable *Apps from Unknown Sources* if prompted.
- **Android TV / Google TV** — sideload the APK with your tool of choice (e.g. *Send files to TV*,
  a USB drive, or `adb install OwnTV.apk`).

> Only install the APK from this repository's official Releases (or the `…/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk`
> link above). It's the build signed by this project's CI — third-party re-hosts aren't endorsed.

## 🛠️ Building & running

1. Open the project in **Android Studio** (a version matching AGP 9.x) and let Gradle sync.
2. Run the `app` configuration on an **Android TV** emulator or device. The app declares
   `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER` and requires the leanback feature, so it appears in the **TV launcher**, not the
   phone launcher.
3. Or from the command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

On first launch you'll go through onboarding: accept the disclaimer, create a profile, then **add a
source** (M3U or Xtream) — or import a backup. After it imports, browse from the sidebar and open the
**Guide** for the EPG. Everything is managed under **Settings**.

**Tested on:** a real **TCL Google TV**, and the **Android Studio emulator** (both the Android TV and
Google TV system images).

## 🤖 CI & releases

GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/android.yml`](.github/workflows/android.yml)) builds the app in the
cloud — no local build needed:

- **Every push / PR** → builds a debug APK and uploads it as a workflow **artifact** named
  `OwnTV-v<version>-<sha>.apk` (download it from the run's *Summary → Artifacts*).
- **Push a `v*` tag** (e.g. `git tag v1.1.0 && git push origin v1.1.0`) → builds a **signed** APK and
  publishes a **GitHub Release** with `OwnTV-v1.1.0.apk` attached. The release notes are taken from
  the newest section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) (which the in-app updater shows as
  "What's new"), plus GitHub's auto-generated commit list.

**Versioning is automatic**: `versionName`/`versionCode` are derived from the tag (e.g. `v1.1.0` →
`1.1.0` / `10100`) — no need to touch `build.gradle.kts`.

**Signed release builds (optional, recommended for distribution).** Tag builds are debug-signed until you
add a release keystore. Create one and add four repo **Secrets** to get properly signed releases:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore owntv.keystore -alias owntv -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
base64 -w0 owntv.keystore   # copy the output into the KEYSTORE_BASE64 secret
```

Then add repo Secrets (*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*): `KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`. Keep the keystore file private — it's never committed.
